# Race Car Game Backend

This is the backend server for the Race Car Game project.

## Project Structure

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd racecar_game/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your configuration:
   ```
   MNEMONIC_PHRASE=your_mnemonic_phrase_here
   ```

## Running the Server

To start the server:
npm start 


This will run the `src/server.js` file.

## Dependencies

- @unique-nft/sr25519: For cryptographic operations
- .env: For managing environment variables
- (List other major dependencies here)

## Development

- The main server file is `src/server.js`
- Environment variables are managed using `.tenv`
- (Add any other important development notes)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split')", ensure that your `.env` file is set up correctly and that the `MNEMONIC_PHRASE` is properly defined.
